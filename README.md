## About the Project

Miusie is a custom-built e-commerce platform designed specifically for my small business, a simple way to manage pre-orders without the overhead of traditional platforms like Shopify. This platform was built to avoid €50+ Shopify costs - which isn’t a huge amount, but when you’re not guaranteed sales, every cost matters. It's my full-stack project and taught me how to build an MVP from scratch.
